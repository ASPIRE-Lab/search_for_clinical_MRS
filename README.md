# Semi-automated Database Search Pipeline for Clinical MRS Research Papers and Journals

The semi-automated database search pipeline enables users to identify journals publishing clinical MRS research papers, as well as the papers themselves. Especially useful for identifying and exporting information pertaining to individual research papers on the topic of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that have been published in clinical journals. May also be used to identify those clinical journals most actively publishing in vivo MRS research during a given time period. Data optionally exported as csv file after each session. This search pipeline provides the advanced search query in the format used by Clarivate's Journal Citation Reports (JCR) and Web of Science (WOS). 

### Features

- Use JCR to Identify journals within select categories
- Filter journal list to include only journals with publications within a given year (2021 is default) or publication date range.
- Filter journal list to include only journals with a journal import factor (JIF) above a user-specified threshold (>2 is default).
- Export list of journal names (and other journal-associated JCR information) as csv file (up to 600 records exportable at a time).
- Use Web of Science (WOS) to identify individual papers (records) published by specified journals (e.g. the list output by JCR search).
- Export search output as an easy-to-interpret csv file with record-associated WOS information (including title, abstract, authors, and other citation-related information for each record).
